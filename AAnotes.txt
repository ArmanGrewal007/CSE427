A linked clone is created from a master VM and shares virtual disks with its parent VM but has its own delta disk for changes.
VM > Manage > Clone from current state > Linked clone

A full clone is a complete copy of a VM, including all virtual disks and settings. 
VM > Manage > Clone from current state > Full clone 

A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of a VM's state.

A template is a pre-configured VM that can be used to create new VMs quickly and consistently.

Open Virtualization Format is a standard format for packaging and distributing VMs.

vSphere Availability is a set of features and functionalities in VMware vSphere that is designed to ensure the availability and uptime of virtual machines (VMs) running on the platform
E.g. DRS, High Availability, Fault Tolerance, ...
VSphere has a master slave architecture in which some VMs are clustered together and one master is selected from them using election process, and rest are slaves. The master host is responsible for monitoring the health of the other hosts in the cluster, and for detecting and responding to failures. Election process occurs when ->
	HA is enabled
	Master host fails/shutdowns/goes into maintainance mode
	Management network partition occurs
HA is a feature in VSphere availability that provides automatic restart of VMs in host failure.

DRS is responsible for balancing resource utilization across the cluster, ensuring that VMs are distributed evenly across the hosts and that resources are utilized efficiently. Memory Usage/Network Usage/Storage Usage

Heartbeat Datastores is another layer of protection allows vSphere HA to monitor hosts when a management network partition occurs and to continue to respond to failures that occur.

FT is a VMWare VSphere feature that provide continuous availability of VMs by creating a live shadow copy of a primary VM. The shadow copy, known as the secondary VM, runs on a different host in the cluster than the primary VM and is kept in sync with the primary VM in real-time.
